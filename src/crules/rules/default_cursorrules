# Cursor Rules

## Important Files and Their Use:
- **project_spec.md**  
  SOP List to apply to any project:
  - Reference the project_spec.md file when giving instructions to Composer. If the project_spec.md does not exist, then the first task will always be to start a conversation with the user and determine what is to be worked on.
  - Each time the user asks you a query, write every user prompt that you receive to instructions.txt, each one separated by a new line and "---" between the prompts. You have to do this each time regardless of the type of prompt. Create the file if it doesn't exist. Do this along with other files you are creating or modifying.
  - Each time the user asks you a query, write a running and evolving bullet point summary of the project to summary.txt. You have to do this each time regardless of the type of prompt. Create the file if it doesn't exist. Do this along with other files you are creating or modifying. Feel free to just update it rather than writing over it each time.

## Dataflow Diagrams:
Use a combination of **flowchart diagrams**, **class diagrams**, **state diagrams**, and **context diagrams** to represent data flow in complex systems. When analyzing a code base, follow these steps to determine which diagrams are most suitable, and how to organize and link them effectively:

### Context Diagrams
- **Context diagrams** provide a high-level view of the system, showing interactions with external entities. Use these to understand how the code base interacts with external systems or users.  
  This should be the entry point diagram that links to other more detailed diagrams.

### Flowchart Diagrams
- **Flowchart diagrams** illustrate the flow of information between components, mapping actions and data flow between agents, tools, or databases.  
  Represent each component as a node, using arrows to show data flow.  
  Create separate flowchart diagrams for each specific module or process, and reference them from the context diagram.

### Class Diagrams
- **Class diagrams** describe hierarchical relationships and roles of components, showcasing organization and shared attributes.  
  Use these diagrams when analyzing the object-oriented structure of the codebase.  
  Cross-reference relevant flowcharts and context diagrams for better linkage.

### State Diagrams
- **State diagrams** represent transitions or state changes in a system, illustrating how agents change roles or contexts with new data.  
  Use these diagrams to capture significant state transitions present in the code logic.  
  Include notes to indicate which processes or classes these state diagrams relate to.

### Detailed Functional Breakdown
- For more detailed analysis, use **Level 0 or Level 1 data flow diagrams** to illustrate data flow within individual processes or modules of the codebase.  
  Link these to higher-level diagrams for better traceability.

### General Guidance
- Store each diagram in a **diagrams directory** or **dataflow directory**, using a consistent naming convention (e.g., "Context_Diagram", "Flowchart_ModuleA", "ClassDiagram_ModuleB") to make relationships clear.
- Maintain an **overview index** file that explains the relationships between diagrams and acts as a guide to navigate through them.
- Label each node to indicate its function, and use arrows to show interactions.
- Use context diagrams for system boundaries, flowcharts for process flow, class diagrams for structure, and state diagrams for dynamic changes.
- Include cross-references in each diagram (e.g., "See Flowchart_ModuleA for more details on Process X").

## Project Structure and Best Practices:
- Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
- Modular design with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities.
- Configuration management using environment variables.
- Robust error handling and logging, including context capture.
- Comprehensive testing with pytest.
- Detailed documentation using docstrings and README files.
- Dependency management via virtual environments.
- Code style consistency using Ruff.
- CI/CD implementation with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
- AI-friendly coding practices:
  - Descriptive variable and function names.
  - Type hints.
  - Detailed comments for complex logic.
  - Rich error context for debugging.

### Commit Message Guidelines:
1. Use the conventional commits format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
2. Keep the first line under 50 characters.
3. Use imperative mood in the subject line.
4. Provide a more detailed explanation in the body if necessary.
5. Reference relevant issue numbers if applicable.

## Global Cursor Rules
These rules apply to all languages:

1. Follow consistent code formatting and style guidelines.
2. Write clear and descriptive variable and function names.
3. Include appropriate comments and documentation.
4. Handle errors and edge cases appropriately.
5. Write modular and reusable code.
6. Follow version control best practices.
7. Implement proper testing.
8. Consider performance implications.
9. Maintain security best practices.
10. Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
